## April 2025 - UI Enhancements and Persistence

### Sprint Goals (April 2025)

After reviewing the current state of the Orchestrate MVP, we've identified the following priorities for this sprint:

#### 1. UI Improvements

- **Enhanced Workflow Visualization**
  - Implement a more intuitive visual representation of workflow steps
  - Add clearer indicators for step dependencies and execution flow
  - Improve the layout for better readability of complex workflows

- **Execution Controls**
  - Add run/pause/stop functionality for workflow execution
  - Implement step-by-step execution option for debugging
  - Provide real-time execution progress indicators
  - Add clear status indicators for each step (pending, running, completed, failed)

- **Result Display**
  - Enhance formatting options for different types of results
  - Add collapsible sections for long outputs
  - Implement syntax highlighting for code outputs
  - Add export functionality for results

#### 2. Persistence with Supabase

- **Workflow Storage**
  - Set up Supabase integration for database storage
  - Implement save/load functionality for workflows
  - Add versioning support for workflows

- **Result History**
  - Store execution results with timestamps
  - Implement result comparison functionality
  - Add filtering and searching capabilities for past results

- **User Management**
  - Basic user authentication
  - Workflow ownership and permissions
  - Sharing capabilities for collaborative workflows

#### 3. Technical Improvements

- Fix import structure issues for easier deployment
- Enhance error handling, especially in the UI
- Improve logging for better debugging
- Add more comprehensive testing for the OpenAI integration

#### 4. Documentation

- Create a basic user guide for the enhanced features
- Document the setup process for new users
- Add more example workflows showcasing different use cases

### Success Criteria

By the end of this sprint, we aim to have:

1. A significantly improved user interface that makes workflow creation and execution more intuitive
2. Basic persistence functionality allowing users to save and retrieve their workflows
3. More robust error handling to prevent common user mistakes
4. Sufficient documentation for users to get started without extensive guidance

## March 2025 - MVP with OpenAI Integration

### Project Status (March 2025)

Orchestrate has reached a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) state with the following components implemented:

#### Core Components

1. **Workflow Engine**
   - Complete implementation of the workflow execution engine
   - Support for sequential step execution
   - Proper error handling and result management
   - Asynchronous execution support

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Mock LLM client for testing and development
   - OpenAI integration with GPT-4o support
   - Environment-based configuration

3. **Parser & Models**
   - YAML workflow definition parser
   - Data models for workflows and steps
   - Serialization/deserialization support

4. **User Interface**
   - Streamlit-based web interface
   - Workflow visualization and execution
   - Real-time execution tracking
   - Result display and management

#### Testing

- Unit tests for the workflow engine
- Tests for the OpenAI client integration
- Mock workflow tests for end-to-end testing

#### Running the Application

The application can be run in two modes:

1. **Mock LLM Mode** (for development and testing)
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. ORCHESTRATE_USE_MOCK=true streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

2. **OpenAI Integration Mode** (for production use)
   ```bash
   ./demo.py
   # or
   PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

#### Next Steps

The following features are planned for future development:

1. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced workflow visualization
   - Better step dependency visualization
   - Improved result display with formatting options

2. **Persistence**
   - Workflow storage in Supabase
   - Result history and versioning
   - User authentication and workflow sharing

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Parallel step execution
   - Conditional branching in workflows
   - Custom function integration
   - More LLM provider integrations

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive user guide
   - API documentation
   - Example workflow library

#### Known Issues

1. Limited error handling in the UI
2. No persistence of workflows or results between sessions
