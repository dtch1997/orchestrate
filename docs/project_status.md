# Orchestrate Project Status

## Overview

Orchestrate is a framework for defining, executing, and managing AI workflows using YAML. The project allows users to create multi-step workflows where each step can leverage LLM capabilities, with results from previous steps feeding into subsequent ones.

## Current Status

As of March 2025, the project has reached a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) state with the following components implemented:

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Engine**
   - Complete implementation of the workflow execution engine
   - Support for sequential step execution
   - Proper error handling and result management
   - Asynchronous execution support

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Mock LLM client for testing and development
   - OpenAI integration with GPT-4o support
   - Environment-based configuration

3. **Parser & Models**
   - YAML workflow definition parser
   - Data models for workflows and steps
   - Serialization/deserialization support

4. **User Interface**
   - Streamlit-based web interface
   - Workflow visualization and execution
   - Real-time execution tracking
   - Result display and management

### Testing

- Unit tests for the workflow engine
- Tests for the OpenAI client integration
- Mock workflow tests for end-to-end testing

## Running the Application

The application can be run in two modes:

1. **Mock LLM Mode** (for development and testing)
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. ORCHESTRATE_USE_MOCK=true streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

2. **OpenAI Integration Mode** (for production use)
   ```bash
   ./demo.py
   # or
   PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

## Next Steps

The following features are planned for future development:

1. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced workflow visualization
   - Better step dependency visualization
   - Improved result display with formatting options

2. **Persistence**
   - Workflow storage in Supabase
   - Result history and versioning
   - User authentication and workflow sharing

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Parallel step execution
   - Conditional branching in workflows
   - Custom function integration
   - More LLM provider integrations

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive user guide
   - API documentation
   - Example workflow library

## Known Issues

1. Limited error handling in the UI
2. No persistence of workflows or results between sessions

## Contributing

The project follows standard development practices:

1. Use PDM for package management
2. Write tests for new features
3. Follow the import structure guidelines
4. Make incremental commits with clear messages
