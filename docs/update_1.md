# Orchestrate: Implementation Status Update

## Current Status

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Data Models** (`src/orchestrate/models.py`)
   - ✅ `WorkflowStep`: Represents a single step with ID and prompt
   - ✅ `Workflow`: Contains metadata and a list of steps
   - ✅ `StepResult`: Captures result and execution time of a step
   - ✅ `WorkflowResult`: Aggregates results from all steps in a workflow

2. **YAML Parser** (`src/orchestrate/parser.py`)
   - ✅ Loading workflows from YAML files
   - ✅ Validation of required fields and structure
   - ✅ Conversion between YAML and Workflow objects

3. **Execution Engine** (`src/orchestrate/engine.py`)
   - ✅ Asynchronous workflow execution
   - ✅ Step execution with context passing
   - ✅ Progress tracking via callbacks
   - ✅ Error handling and reporting

4. **Mock LLM Client** (`src/orchestrate/mock_llm.py`)
   - ✅ Simulated LLM responses for testing
   - ✅ Configurable delay to mimic real API latency
   - ✅ Environment variable toggle (`ORCHESTRATE_USE_MOCK`)

5. **CLI Interface** (`src/orchestrate/cli.py`)
   - ✅ Command-line workflow execution
   - ✅ Progress reporting
   - ✅ Result saving to JSON

6. **Streamlit UI** (`src/orchestrate/app.py`)
   - ✅ Interactive web interface
   - ✅ YAML editor
   - ✅ Workflow visualization and execution
   - ✅ Example workflow loading

### Example Workflows

- ✅ Marketing Campaign Generator (`examples/marketing.yaml`)
- ✅ AI Debate (`examples/debate.yaml`)
- ✅ D&D Adventure Generator (`examples/dnd_adventure.yaml`)

### Testing

- ✅ Unit tests for workflow engine
- ✅ Mock workflow execution tests

## Proposed Next Steps

### MVP Focus Areas

1. **OpenAI Integration** (Highest Priority)
   - [ ] Implement OpenAI client in `src/orchestrate/llm.py`
   - [ ] Add API key configuration via environment variables
   - [ ] Support for basic model parameters (model selection, temperature)

2. **Essential UI Improvements**
   - [ ] Clearer workflow visualization
   - [ ] Real-time execution progress indicators
   - [ ] Basic step manipulation (add, remove, reorder)
   - [ ] Improved result display with formatting options
   - [ ] **Workflow Execution Controls:**
     - [ ] Run/pause/stop workflow execution
     - [ ] Step-by-step execution option
     - [ ] Execution history and result persistence
     - [ ] Clear execution status indicators

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 1. Real LLM Integration

- [ ] Support for different models and parameters
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling

### 2. Enhanced Workflow Features

- [ ] Support for conditional branching in workflows
- [ ] Parallel step execution where appropriate
- [ ] Input parameters for workflows
- [ ] Step templates and reusable components

### 3. UI Improvements

- [ ] Workflow visualization graph
- [ ] Real-time execution progress
- [ ] Result history and comparison
- [ ] Export/import of results
- [ ] Workflow template library
- [ ] **Interactive Workflow Manipulation:**
  - [ ] Card-based UI for workflow steps with drag-and-drop reordering
  - [ ] Workflow duplication and tabbed interface for working with multiple workflows
  - [ ] Intelligent workflow merging (similar to git merge) for combining related workflows
  - [ ] Visual feedback during workflow execution showing active steps

### 4. Data Persistence

- [ ] Save/load workflows to/from database
- [ ] User authentication and workflow ownership
- [ ] Execution history and analytics
- [ ] Tagging and organization of workflows
- [ ] **Supabase Integration for File Persistence**

### 5. Advanced Features

- [ ] Workflow scheduling
- [ ] Webhook integration for triggers and notifications
- [ ] Custom step types beyond LLM calls
- [ ] Integration with external tools and APIs
- [ ] Prompt library and management

### 6. Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Comprehensive user guide
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] More example workflows for different use cases
- [ ] Best practices for workflow design

### 7. Deployment

- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Cloud deployment instructions
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and logging

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Implement the OpenAI client in `src/orchestrate/llm.py` with basic functionality
   - Use GPT-4o as the default model
   - Load API key from .env file using python-dotenv
2. Create a `demo.py` file that imports the main app logic and handles environment setup
3. Fix the import structure issues for easier deployment
4. Enhance the Streamlit UI with basic workflow visualization improvements
5. Create a simple user guide for early adopters

## Technical Debt and Issues

- Fix import structure to avoid relative import issues (Priority for MVP)
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add basic testing for the OpenAI integration
- Document setup process for new users

## MVP Success Criteria

- Users can successfully create and run workflows with real OpenAI models
- UI is intuitive enough for users to create workflows without extensive documentation
- System is stable enough to gather meaningful feedback
- Basic error handling prevents common user mistakes
