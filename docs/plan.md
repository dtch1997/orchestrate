# Orchestrate Implementation Plan

## Overview

Orchestrate is a workflow orchestration tool designed to define, execute, and manage multi-step AI-powered workflows using a YAML specification. This document outlines the implementation plan for the MVP and future enhancements.

## MVP Features

For the initial MVP, we will focus on:

1. **Workflow YAML Specification** - Simple format with step ID and prompt
2. **Workflow Execution Engine** - Async execution of workflow steps

## Implementation Units

### 1. Core Data Models (Estimated time: 30 minutes)

- Create basic data models for `Workflow` and `WorkflowStep`
- Keep the initial models simple with just ID and prompt fields
- Design with extensibility in mind for future input/output support

```python
# src/orchestrate/models.py
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel

class WorkflowStep(BaseModel):
    id: str
    prompt: str
    
class Workflow(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str = ""
    steps: List[WorkflowStep]
```

### 2. YAML Parser (Estimated time: 30 minutes)

- Implement functions to load workflow definitions from YAML
- Support parsing of the simplified workflow format
- Include validation to ensure proper structure

```python
# src/orchestrate/parser.py
import yaml
from .models import Workflow, WorkflowStep

def load_workflow_from_yaml(yaml_content: str) -> Workflow:
    # Parse YAML content into a Workflow object
    ...

def workflow_to_yaml(workflow: Workflow) -> str:
    # Convert a Workflow object back to YAML string
    ...
```

### 3. Execution Engine (Estimated time: 1 hour)

- Build an async execution engine for running workflow steps
- Implement a simple step executor that processes prompts
- Add callbacks for step start/completion to support UI updates

```python
# src/orchestrate/engine.py
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Any, Callable, Awaitable, Optional
from .models import Workflow, WorkflowStep

async def execute_workflow(
    workflow: Workflow,
    on_step_start: Optional[Callable[[str], None]] = None,
    on_step_complete: Optional[Callable[[str, Any], None]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Execute workflow steps in sequence
    ...
```

### 4. Streamlit UI (Estimated time: 2 hours)

- Create a Streamlit app for workflow management and execution
- Implement UI for loading, viewing, and executing workflows
- Add real-time feedback during workflow execution

```python
# src/orchestrate/app.py
import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from .models import Workflow
from .parser import load_workflow_from_yaml, workflow_to_yaml
from .engine import execute_workflow

# Streamlit app implementation
...
```

### 5. Example Workflows (Estimated time: 30 minutes)

- Create sample workflow YAML files for demonstration
- Include examples like marketing campaign generation and AI debates
- Store examples in a dedicated directory

```yaml
# examples/marketing.yaml
name: Marketing Campaign Generator
description: Generate a marketing campaign for a product

steps:
  - id: gather_info
    prompt: Prompt user for basic product details.

  - id: generate_outline
    prompt: Generate a high-level marketing outline.
    
  # Additional steps...
```

### 6. Project Configuration (Estimated time: 30 minutes)

- Update pyproject.toml with required dependencies
- Configure project structure and entry points
- Add documentation

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "orchestrate"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Workflow orchestration tool for AI tasks"
dependencies = [
    "streamlit>=1.22.0",
    "pyyaml>=6.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
]
# Additional configuration...
```

## Future Enhancements

After completing the MVP, we plan to add:

1. **Input/Output Support** - Add input/output fields to steps for data passing
2. **Workflow Trace Caching** - Store execution history for debugging and resuming
3. **Results Viewer** - Enhanced UI for viewing workflow execution results
4. **Gallery of Curated Workflows** - Library of example workflows for different use cases

## Development Approach

1. Implement each unit in sequence, starting with core models
2. Test each component individually before integration
3. Focus on simplicity and extensibility
4. Maintain clean separation of concerns between components

## Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests for core components (parser, engine)
- Manual testing of the Streamlit UI
- End-to-end testing with example workflows

## Deployment

- Package as a Python library with Streamlit app entry point
- Document installation and usage instructions in README.md
