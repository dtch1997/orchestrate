  - Step 1: Generate a riddle about a user-specified topic
  - Step 2: Solve the generated riddle
- This simple example provides an ideal test case for the UI improvements

#### Next Steps

1. **Persistence Layer**
   - Begin implementation of Supabase integration for workflow storage
   - Design database schema for workflows, results, and user data
   - Implement save/load functionality for workflows and results

2. **UI Polish**
   - Add visual connections between dependent steps
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Enhance accessibility features

3. **Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive tests for the UI components
   - Create integration tests for the workflow execution engine
   - Implement end-to-end tests for the complete application

4. **Documentation**
   - Begin work on user guide with screenshots of the new UI
   - Document the workflow definition format with examples
   - Create setup instructions for new users

The recent UI improvements have significantly enhanced the usability of the application, making it more intuitive and providing better feedback during workflow execution. The code refactoring has improved maintainability and will make it easier to implement the remaining features.
