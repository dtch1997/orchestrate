# Orchestrate Development Notes

This document contains running notes on the development of the Orchestrate project, with the most recent updates at the top.

## March 2025 - MVP with OpenAI Integration

### Project Status (March 2025)

Orchestrate has reached a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) state with the following components implemented:

#### Core Components

1. **Workflow Engine**
   - Complete implementation of the workflow execution engine
   - Support for sequential step execution
   - Proper error handling and result management
   - Asynchronous execution support

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Mock LLM client for testing and development
   - OpenAI integration with GPT-4o support
   - Environment-based configuration

3. **Parser & Models**
   - YAML workflow definition parser
   - Data models for workflows and steps
   - Serialization/deserialization support

4. **User Interface**
   - Streamlit-based web interface
   - Workflow visualization and execution
   - Real-time execution tracking
   - Result display and management

#### Testing

- Unit tests for the workflow engine
- Tests for the OpenAI client integration
- Mock workflow tests for end-to-end testing

#### Running the Application

The application can be run in two modes:

1. **Mock LLM Mode** (for development and testing)
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. ORCHESTRATE_USE_MOCK=true streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

2. **OpenAI Integration Mode** (for production use)
   ```bash
   ./demo.py
   # or
   PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run src/orchestrate/app.py
   ```

#### Next Steps

The following features are planned for future development:

1. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhanced workflow visualization
   - Better step dependency visualization
   - Improved result display with formatting options

2. **Persistence**
   - Workflow storage in Supabase
   - Result history and versioning
   - User authentication and workflow sharing

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Parallel step execution
   - Conditional branching in workflows
   - Custom function integration
   - More LLM provider integrations

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive user guide
   - API documentation
   - Example workflow library

#### Known Issues

1. Limited error handling in the UI
2. No persistence of workflows or results between sessions

## February 2025 - Initial Development

### Initial Project Setup

- Created basic project structure
- Implemented workflow engine with mock LLM client
- Added YAML parser for workflow definitions
- Created Streamlit-based UI for workflow visualization and execution
- Added example workflows for testing

### Testing Framework

- Set up pytest for testing
- Created unit tests for workflow engine
- Added mock workflow tests for end-to-end testing
